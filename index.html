      <p> <strong> Hello There! I'm Nikki Beesetti, </strong> and I'm a sophomore studying Electrical Engineering (with a focus in software engineering) at Purdue University. This summer, I started teaching myself HTML, PHP, Javascript, and other web programming languages just for jokes and giggles. But it wasn't too long until I found myself really enjoying what I had gotten myself into. I was so hooked on all things web developement-ey that I decided to make my very own website! </p>
      </br><br>
      
     <p> <strong>At first, </strong> I was strongly considering using  bootstrap templates to make my website look more pizzazzled(is that even a word) and help me cut down on time. But then I realized, I really really wanted to make a product that was authentic and something that I could call my own. </p>
     <br></br>
      
   <p>  <strong>So I made this. </strong> Yup all this made from scratch, everything from the design side to the coding side. If you are interested in staring at the magic behind my website, take a peek at <a href="https://github.com/nikkibeesetti">my Github. </a></p>
   <br></br>
   

  <p> <strong>Now that you've been reading this far into my website </strong>, I have joke for you to laugh at (or you can laugh at me, whatever works): When is the only time you use safari? To download chrome 
   <br></br>
   
   <p> <strong>Got any questions? </strong> or would you like to send me some jokes yourself, contact me below! </p> <br></br>

      <h6 style="float: center";> Text a Charity </h6>
      
      <p> <strong>Text a Charity is the first project in my portfolio. </strong>I made this at Battlehack Chicago. The event was sponsored by PayPal, SendGrid, and a few other companies( it was spectacular btw). It was the first time I got to use my technical skillset in a practical setting. I had a complete blast and learned more from that hackathon than I have in some of my semester-long engineering classes. This was the first hackathon I ever went to, and <strong>my team and I won first place for best use of API's.</strong> This event prompted me to change my major and helped me decide that I wanted to work in the software industry. To learn more about my experience, view my blog post about it! </p>
      <br></br>
      <p> <strong>Let's talk about the content of my app. </strong> My team and I created an application called Text a Charity. This app allows one to pick a charity one is interested in and from there our application will pinpoint similar charities based on location and output descriptions and contact information about the charity. My team and I created a website, text-messaging, and emailing system where users can gain more knowledge on their selected charity-cause. We created a website where a user can enter in an organization they care about in the search bar, and our page will spit out an organization that you can donate to. Once you have entered in an organization , the page will output a description, email info, and additional details about the charity. In addition, our users can even find out about a charity by sending us a message via text message or even email. Basically how this works is our users will text or email us, and in the message/subject line they will enter in a cause they are passionate about(for example cancer). After that, they will receive a message/email displaying information about the charity. </p>
      <br></br>
	  <p> <strong> As far as the platforms used, </strong> we used Twilio for building the SMS logic in our web application, Just Giving for the database of charities and the donate links, and SendGrid for emailing charity info. </p>
	  <br></br> 
	  <p> <strong> Try it out for yourself now! </strong> We created three different services to allow a user to view a charity of their choice. 
	  <ol> • <strong>Visit</strong> <a href=https://suefeng.com/battlehack2015>suefeng.com/battlehack2015</a> and enter in a cause you are interested in. Our search engine will output similar charities based on your location. </ol>
	  <ol> • <strong>Text us a charity keyword</strong> at +1(309)929-4615. For example send us a message with a text input saying Susan. Our SMS Text Messaging application will output charities with the keyword Susan around your area. If you interested in the first charity that pops up, text back MORE for more details; or text back NEXT to see the next charity that was found. </ol>
	  <ol> • <strong>Email us at</strong> me@tac.bymail.in . Send us a charity name on the subject line and our email deliverability function will output your desired charity. </ol>
      <br></br>

	  <h6> My Website </h6>
	  <p> This website is my work in progress project. I coded this entirely from scratch. I used mainly HTML and CSS. This website you are staring into is my baby and as time goes by she will evolve and have more content to discuss about. But for now, this her.
